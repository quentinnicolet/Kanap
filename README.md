#Kanap
Kanap is a highly useful tool for web developers who are working on Project 5 of the Web Developer path. It serves as both the front-end and back-end server, which means it handles both the client-side and server-side of the application. This makes it an important tool for building web applications that require both front-end and back-end functionality.

To use the back-end functionality of Kanap, you must first ensure that you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your machine. Specifically, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed locally on your machine. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, while npm is a package manager that allows you to install and manage packages and dependencies.

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can proceed with installing the back-end of Kanap. To do this, begin by cloning the repository. This will create a local copy of the project on your machine. After cloning the repository, navigate to the "back" folder of the project in your terminal or command prompt. From here, run the command "npm install" to install all the necessary dependencies required for the back-end to work.

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the server by running the command "node server" from within the "back" folder. By default, the server should run on localhost using port 3000. However, if the server is running on another port for any reason, this information will be displayed in the console when the server starts up, such as "Listening on port 3001".

Overall, Kanap is a powerful tool that simplifies the development process for web developers. Its ability to handle both the front-end and back-end of an application makes it a valuable asset in any developer's toolkit.
